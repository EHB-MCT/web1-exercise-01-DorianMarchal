    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105째F-115째F)</li>
        <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups (490 g) bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water
            and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.

            After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom,
            indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a
            minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.

            Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.

            If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.

            The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more
            flour.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn
            it around so that it gets coated with the oil.

            At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours
            in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm
            place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.

            Cover the dough with plastic wrap.

            For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75째F to 85째F) for 1 1/2 hours.

            For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine)
            for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).

            The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.
